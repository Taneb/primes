# Primes

This repository contains a number of proofs related to prime numbers, in Agda.
It is intended to be compatible with Agda's [standard
library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib), although it may require an
unreleased or even unmerged version. As I go I'm trying to add things I've
proven from here into the standard library.
